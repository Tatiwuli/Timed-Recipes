# Microwave Recipes WebApp

## Project Overview

This web application was developed to address the challenges faced by college students in managing time, budget, and nutrition. As part of my university program, I traveled to six different countries while pursuing my bachelor's degree. Due to this nomadic lifestyle, access to affordable dining facilities was limited, and eating out was often unaffordable. At the same time, as a workout enthusiast, maintaining proper nutrition was a key principle I upheld throughout university.

To overcome these challenges, I brainstormed ways to prepare nutritious meals quickly with simple ingredients. Recognizing that many college students face similar struggles, I compiled all the successful recipes that make nutritious meals in under 10 minutes into the **Microwave Recipes WebApp**.
